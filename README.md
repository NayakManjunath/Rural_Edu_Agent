📘 Rural Education Agent 

This project is a simplified, refactored, and modular version of the Rural Education AI Agent designed for learning support in rural environments.
It demonstrates how multiple lightweight agents can collaborate to answer student questions using:

A mock LLM (so no API key required)

Modular agent-based architecture

Search → Summarize → (Optional) Translate → Respond pipeline

Session memory for continuity

A clean Streamlit UI

🚀 Features
✔ Agent-based modular pipeline

The system contains the following agents:

Planner – Decides which steps to run

Searcher – Finds relevant learning resources

Summarizer – Produces a simple summary (mock LLM)

Translator – Converts to target language (mock)

Session Memory – Stores user progress in JSON

✔ Mock LLM

The function call_llm() returns a predictable mock output:

MOCK:<prompt>


This makes the project:

Fully runnable offline

Safe for demos

Zero API cost

Easy to convert into a real agent later

✔ Streamlit Web Interface

A simple UI to interact with the agent:

streamlit run app_streamlit.py

🛠 Installation
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>

2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows

3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ How to Run the Project
Run the command-line agent
python run_agent.py

Run the Streamlit App
streamlit run app_streamlit.py


This opens a web UI where you can type a question and get output generated by the mock LLM and agents.

🧠 How It Works (Simplified Pipeline)

User enters a question

Planner decides the required steps

Searcher finds best matching resources

Summarizer condenses the content using the mock LLM

Translator (optional) converts to another language

Memory stores the last response

Final answer returned to the UI

🧩 Switching to Real LLMs (Optional Upgrade)

To use OpenAI models:

Install:

pip install openai python-dotenv


Add .env:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key


Replace call_llm() with a real API call.

I can generate this upgraded version if you want.
